Syncing my Obsidian notes.  
Is scrubbed, feel free to use them.  
You can clone and import the content directly into your Obsidian, or use them as a flat file notes directory.  
Just import the vault into obsidian and "that's that", as they say.  

### AoC2022  
This is just me copying and apsting notes from TryHackMe's 2022 Advent of Cyber challenges.  

### General Notes  
This is a container for general knowledge that I just started building.  

### Pentest Template Master  
This started as an import of TJ Null's pentesting template for the CherryTree note taking application, imported to Obsidian. I have since started adding more to it here and there. FEEL FREE TO SAVE A COPY, IT'S GREAT INFO!!!  

### Template  
This is just a template that I use to construct blog posts from within Obsidian. Mostly useless to you.
